This project was created as an exercise in creating a React frontend with Typescript, connecting to my MongoDB database through an API written in NodeJS.

The database includes four different collections of players, games, tournaments, and maps.

This project was inspired by TLPD, a database of professional Starcraft games, that has not been updated since 2019. Much of the information comes from the wiki Liquipedia run by tl.net.

To create your own copy of the site, replace the environment variables with the name and password of your own Atlas database. At some point in the future I plan to make available all of the data from my database available publicly as a JSON file.
